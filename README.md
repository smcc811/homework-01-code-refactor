Code Refactor


Homework assignment was to reformat badly constucted HTML/CSS code making it easier to read and maintain.
In the process we learned  to utilize the following tools, Visual Code, Get Bash , GETHUB, along with the Internet
using best coding practices to achieve the goal .

The original HTML file was utilizing the same tag to cover a spectrum  of different scenarios
in the file .  The file itself was very unstructed and hard to understand and follow . The
CSS file conained numerous code features whose objective was redundant .

The objective of this exercise was to incorporate tags with a clearer meaning that would
make the code more readable and limit the overuse of just one tag throughout without 
altering the objective of the web page .

The CSS file also contained snippets of code that were redundant in nature and 
consolidation was needed to eliminate the excess while at the same time providing  the
needs of the HTML File .

The motivation behind this project was twofold ,  restructing both files and learning new
ways to utilize a variety of tags and with those tags , reformat the code into a more
readable document that could be understood and maintained by other developers .

The experience gained was an introduction to HTML / CSS file structure , features
and limitations of both languages and how both work together to create a descriptive end 
product for consumer consumption .

Installation
-------------

Once all changes had been made and tested and a descriptive "readme file" created describing all  changes , 
the code is moved from the PC to the repository stored on GITHUB using Pull / Push technology. Once on GITHUB
code is checked for deployment capabilities and then moved into a " production " environment .

collaboration
-------------

Philip Marzullo was a collaborator on this project and assisted with the remake of the files in question
and assisted with creation of this README file
